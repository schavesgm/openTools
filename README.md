# Collection of scripts to analyse data from openQCD-Fastsum

This repository contains scripts used to produce and analyse data from the FASTSUM
collaboration. It is intended to be a collection of independent folders. In each
folder, there should be a fully functional collection of scripts.

* **concatenateOpenQCD:** Scripts to concatenate openQCD correlation function
data into a single file. Each file will contain N_C x N_S statistics of the
particle to be analysed.

* **extractEffMass:** Collection of scripts to extract the effective mass solving
the cosh function and plotting the data into a pdf using gnp2tex.

* **gnp2tex:** Script to transform gnuplot files to standalone pdf files.
